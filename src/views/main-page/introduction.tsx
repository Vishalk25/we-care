      <div>
        We-Care India, is an award winning NGO that stands for the economic and
        social empowerment of women and children. We-Care started in 2020 with the intent of
        liberating young women and children, through the pursuit of STEM education. The
        initiative prepares young women for leadership roles, thereby creating a
        wider talent pool and helping bridge the gender divide. We-Care
        achieves this objective through a blend of unique development
        interventions, including our 600 hour proprietary and scientifically
        researched curriculum. Over their four years in the program, we also
        provide one-to-one mentorship, access to best in class technology,
        assistance with internships, and world class industry exposure and
        corporate interactions. We-Careâ€™s vision is to empower women and children for
        equality in opportunity and leadership roles.
